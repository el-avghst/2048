# 2048 in python
This repository contains python code for the game 2048.

To run the code, download the 2048.py file and install numpy. Numpy is used to make columns of the output matrix even for the player's convenience. The game also uses random (to update the grid after every move) and os (to keep the player's current and best score) modules.
